            Hi Rainfall,
            I decided to write to you weekly till year's end when I might finally leave you and move on with my life (not sure yet).</p>
            <p>I will not be sending you links every week, but I'll make sure to publish a new one every week, so check back every Monday to see the next week's letter.
            I wanted to recap what happened this week but all I can say is “it's well” and “the LORD is in control.”
          </p>

          <hr class="divider">

          <p>
            Last week was such a time for you, how did it go? I'm glad you have recovered from both the injection and malaria.
            Also, your skin is healing — that's an answered prayer — thank God.
            Your productivity this week is so beautiful, totally love to see it. It's already making sense, hope you are willing to do more.
          </p>
          <p>Even if you don’t see it now, I push you because I don’t ever want to look back one day and realize the person I started this journey with isn’t there anymore.</p>
<p>That’s why I drag you, remind you, and sometimes even annoy you, because I believe in where we’re heading. I’m not perfect and I’m not even there yet myself, but I know we’ll make it. We’ll pull through.</p>

          <hr class="divider">

          <p>
            I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well.
            <em>3 John 1:2</em>
