    Hi Rainfall,<br><br>
    I decided to write to you weekly till year's end when I might finally leave you and move on with my life (not sure yet).<br><br>
    I will not be sending you links every week, but I'll make sure to publish a new one every week, so check back every Monday to see the next week's letter.<br><br>
    I wanted to recap what happened this week but all I can say is “it's well” and “the LORD is in control.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Last week was such a time for you, how did it go? I'm glad you have recovered from both the injection and malaria.<br><br>
    Also, your skin is healing — that's an answered prayer — thank God.<br><br>
    Your productivity this week is so beautiful, totally love to see it. It's already making sense, hope you are willing to do more.
  </p>

  <hr class="divider">

  <p>
    I pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well.<br>
    <em>3 John 1:2</em>
