          Dear Rainfall,<br><br>
          This is our first letter. The start of something soft, honest, and true.  
          Every word here carries a part of our journey — the steps, the sweat, the laughter.  
          I want you to know that this is more than just about fitness.  
          It’s about becoming lighter in body and in spirit.  
          I’m proud of us already.<br><br>
          With care,<br>
          Echo
